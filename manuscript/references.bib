    abstract = {Antitumoral immunity requires organized, spatially nuanced interactions between components of the immune tumor microenvironment (iTME). Understanding this coordinated behavior in effective versus ineffective tumor control will advance immunotherapies. We re-engineered co-detection by indexing (CODEX) for paraffin-embedded tissue microarrays, enabling simultaneous profiling of 140 tissue regions from 35 advanced-stage colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with 56 protein markers. We identified nine conserved, distinct cellular neighborhoods (CNs)-a collection of components characteristic of the CRC iTME. Enrichment of PD-1+CD4+ T cells only within a granulocyte CN positively correlated with survival in a high-risk patient subset. Coupling of tumor and immune CNs, fragmentation of T cell and macrophage CNs, and disruption of inter-CN communication was associated with inferior outcomes. This study provides a framework for interrogating how complex biological processes, such as antitumoral immunity, occur through concerted actions of cells and spatial domains.},

CODEX enables a deep view into the single-cell spatial relationships in tissues and is intended to spur discovery in developmental biology, disease and therapeutic design. Herein, we provide optimized protocols for conjugating purified antibodies to DNA oligonucleotides, validating the conjugation by CODEX staining and executing the CODEX multicycle imaging procedure for both formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and fresh-frozen tissues. In addition, we describe basic image processing and data analysis procedures. We apply this approach to an FFPE human tonsil multicycle experiment.

Hybrid E/M cells have both epithelial and mesenchymal properties reminiscent of chimeras, mythical creatures composed of different animals. The co-expression of epithelial and mesenchymal proteins is a defining feature of hybrid E/M cancer cells. In this review, we discuss the use of cytokeratin (epithelial) and vimentin (mesenchymal) intermediate filaments as markers in hybrid E/M cells. We describe the structures and functions of these filaments that are uniquely expressed in hybrid E/M cells and speculate on potential hybrid structures formed between vimentin and cytokeratin. We also describe cell-surface cytokeratin and vimentin and their functions and discuss their potential as predictive biomarkers and as targets for anti-cancer therapy., The epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) program is critical to metastatic cancer progression. EMT results in the expression of mesenchymal proteins and enhances migratory and invasive capabilities. In a small percentage of cells, EMT results in the expression of stemness-associated genes that provide a metastatic advantage. Although EMT had been viewed as a binary event, it has recently become clear that the program leads to a spectrum of phenotypes, including hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) cells that have significantly greater metastatic capability than cells on the epithelial or mesenchymal ends of the spectrum. As hybrid E/M cells are rarely observed in physiological, non-diseased states in the adult human body, these cells are potential biomarkers and drug targets. Hybrid E/M cells are distinguished by the co-expression of epithelial and mesenchymal proteins, such as the intermediate filament proteins cytokeratin (CK; epithelial) and vimentin (VIM; mesenchymal). Although these intermediate filaments have been extensively used for pathological characterization and detection of aggressive carcinomas, little is known regarding the interactions between CK and VIM when co-expressed in hybrid E/M cells. This review describes the characteristics of hybrid E/M cells with a focus on the unique co-expression of VIM and CK. We will discuss the structures and functions of these two intermediate filament proteins and how they may interact when co-expressed in hybrid E/M cells. Additionally, we review what is known about cell-surface expression of these intermediate filament proteins and discuss their potential as predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets.},

    abstract = {Metastasis is the leading cause of high mortality in colorectal cancer (CRC), which is not only driven by changes occurring within the tumor cells, but is also influenced by the dynamic interaction between cancer cells and components in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Currently, the exploration of TME remodeling and its impact on CRC metastasis has attracted increasing attention owing to its potential to uncover novel therapeutic avenues. Noteworthy, emerging studies suggested that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) within the TME played important roles in CRC metastasis by secreting a variety of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and proteases. Moreover, TAMs are often associated with poor prognosis and drug resistance, making them promising targets for CRC therapy. Given the prognostic and clinical value of TAMs, this review provides an updated overview on the origin, polarization and function of TAMs, and discusses the mechanisms by which TAMs promote the metastatic cascade of CRC. Potential TAM-targeting techniques for personalized theranostics of metastatic CRC are emphasized. Finally, future perspectives and challenges for translational applications of TAMs in CRC development and metastasis are proposed to help develop novel TAM-based strategies for CRC precision medicine and holistic healthcare.},

    abstract = {Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been shown to play a critical role in tumor development from initiation to metastasis. EMT could be regarded as a continuum, with intermediate hybrid epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes having high plasticity. Classical EMT is characterized by the phenotype change of epithelial cells to cells with mesenchymal properties, but EMT is also associated with multiple other molecular processes, including tumor immune evasion. Some previous studies have shown that EMT is associated with the cell number of immunosuppressive cells, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and the expression of immune checkpoints, such as programmed cell death-ligand 1, in several cancer types. At the molecular level, EMT transcriptional factors, including Snail, Zeb1, and Twist1, produce or attract immunosuppressive cells or promote the expression of immunosuppressive checkpoint molecules via chemokine production, leading to a tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. In turn, immunosuppressive factors induce EMT in tumor cells. This feedback loop between EMT and immunosuppression promotes tumor progression. For therapy directly targeting EMT has been challenging, the elucidation of the interactive regulation of EMT and immunosuppression is desirable for developing new therapeutic approaches in cancer. The combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors and immunotherapy targeting immunosuppressive cells could be a promising therapy for EMT.},

    abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Immunotherapy has brought a paradigm shift in the treatment of tumors in recent decades. However, a significant proportion of patients remain unresponsive, largely due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play crucial roles in shaping the TME by exhibiting dual identities as both mediators and responders of inflammation. TAMs closely interact with intratumoral T cells, regulating their infiltration, activation, expansion, effector function, and exhaustion through multiple secretory and surface factors. Nevertheless, the heterogeneous and plastic nature of TAMs renders the targeting of any of these factors alone inadequate and poses significant challenges for mechanistic studies and clinical translation of corresponding therapies. In this review, we present a comprehensive summary of the mechanisms by which TAMs dynamically polarize to influence intratumoral T cells, with a focus on their interaction with other TME cells and metabolic competition. For each mechanism, we also discuss relevant therapeutic opportunities, including non-specific and targeted approaches in combination with checkpoint inhibitors and cellular therapies. Our ultimate goal is to develop macrophage-centered therapies that can fine-tune tumor inflammation and empower immunotherapy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

    abstract = {While regulatory T cells (Tregs) and macrophages have been recognized as key orchestrators of cancer-associated immunosuppression, their cellular crosstalk within tumors has been poorly characterized. Here, using spontaneous models for breast cancer, we demonstrate that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) contribute to the intratumoral accumulation of Tregs by promoting the conversion of conventional CD4+ T cells (Tconvs) into Tregs. Mechanistically, two processes were identified that independently contribute to this process. While TAM-derived TGF-β directly promotes the conversion of CD4+ Tconvs into Tregs in vitro, we additionally show that TAMs enhance PD-1 expression on CD4+ T cells. This indirectly contributes to the intratumoral accumulation of Tregs, as loss of PD-1 on CD4+ Tconvs abrogates intratumoral conversion of adoptively transferred CD4+ Tconvs into Tregs. Combined, this study provides insights into the complex immune cell crosstalk between CD4+ T cells and TAMs in the tumor microenvironment of breast cancer, and further highlights that therapeutic exploitation of macrophages may be an attractive immune intervention to limit the accumulation of Tregs in breast tumors.},

T cells bearing the co-receptor CD4 on their cell surface are a heterogeneous group of T lymphocytes that exert pro- or anti-inflammatory functions. Evidence from mouse models and cancer patients reveal that various CD4+ T cell subsets play an antagonistic role in the antitumor immune response. This review summarizes current knowledge on CD4+ T cell subsets, on how they impact tumor growth in patients, and which role these cells play in newest cancer immunotherapies.
Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy activates the immune system to specifically target malignant cells. Research has often focused on CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, as those have the capacity to eliminate tumor cells after specific recognition upon TCR-MHC class I interaction. However, CD4+ T cells have gained attention in the field, as they are not only essential to promote help to CD8+ T cells, but are also able to kill tumor cells directly (via MHC-class II dependent recognition) or indirectly (e.g., via the activation of other immune cells like macrophages). Therefore, immunotherapy approaches have shifted from only stimulating CD8+ T cells to targeting and assessing both, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets. Here, we discuss the various subsets of CD4+ T cells, their plasticity and functionality, their relevance in the antitumor immune response in patients affected by cancer, and their ever-growing role in therapeutic approaches for human cancer.},

    abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the healthcare burdens in South Africa with a high probability of cancer relapse. Colorectal cancer has been demonstrated to be caused by oncogene activation and deactivation of tumor suppressor genes in the system. Human diseases such as cancer have been reported to be associated with vascular dysfunction which contributes to malignancy, tumor evasion, and metastasis. Vascular dysfunction in most tumors has led to treatment resistance and cancer relapses. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor is mediated by HIF-1 during oxidative stress, hypoxic conditions, or mediated by epidermal growth factor receptor as an oncogene in the development of new abnormal blood vessels in tumors, as well as metastasis in CRC. Angiogenic targeted therapies that are developed thus far against colorectal cancer have been shown to improve the survival rate of patients, nonetheless, poor prognosis is still a major issue for metastatic CRC. Angiogenesis is a critical and promising target for the inhibition of tumor growth, progression, and metastatic CRC therapies. In this review, we report some of the molecular mechanisms of angiogenesis in colorectal cancer. The roles of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Hypoxia-induced factor-1 (HIF-1), and miRNAs as factors that contribute to the induction of VEGF activity to elicit tumor angiogenic pathway in colorectal cancer. Despite the limitations of CRC therapies, several studies have shown that the combination of conventional therapies and pro-angiogenic agents has slightly improved the survival rate of patients. Moreover, studies have shown several ways to target the pro-angiogenic factors in combating tumor angiogenesis and more research is still required to understand the molecular mechanism and pathogenesis of CRC.},

It is designed to handle realistic datasets, including inhomogeneous point patterns, spatial sampling regions of arbitrary shape, extra covariate data, and "marks" attached to the points of the point pattern. 
A unique feature of spatstat is its generic algorithm for fitting point process models to point pattern data. The interface to this algorithm is a function ppm that is strongly analogous to lm and glm. 
This paper is a general description of spatstat and an introduction for new users.},

It has been possible to identify different subclasses of immune environment that have an influence on tumor initiation and response and therapy; by parsing the unique classes and subclasses of tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) that exist within a patient’s tumor, the ability to predict and guide immunotherapeutic responsiveness will improve, and new therapeutic targets will be revealed.},

We perform various Monte Carlo simulation experiments to explore the performances of our approach in terms of estimation and cokriging. The application of the proposed multivariate Matérn model is illustrated on two meteorological datasets: temperature/pressure over the Pacific Northwest (bivariate) and wind/temperature/pressure in Oklahoma (trivariate).

    abstract = {Summary. Multitype spatial point patterns with hierarchical interactions are considered. Here hierarchical interaction means directionality: points on a higher level of hierarchy affect the locations of points on the lower levels, but not vice versa. Such relations are common, for example, in ecological communities. Interacting point patterns are often modeled by Gibbs processes with pairwise interactions. However, these models are inherently symmetric, and the hierarchy can be acknowledged only when interpreting the results. We suggest the following in allowing the inclusion of the hierarchical structure in the model. Instead of regarding the pattern as a realization of a stationary multivariate point process, we build the pattern one type at a time according to the order of the hierarchy by using nonstationary univariate processes. As interactions connected to points x on a certain level are considered, the effect of the higher levels is interpreted as heterogeneity of the pattern x, and the points on the lower levels are neglected because of the hierarchical structure.},

Currently, ecologists most commonly analyze presence-only data by adding randomly chosen “pseudo-absences” to the data such that it can be analyzed using logistic regression, an approach which has weaknesses in model specification, in interpretation, and in implementation. To address these issues, we propose Poisson point process modeling of the intensity of presences. We also derive a link between the proposed approach and logistic regression—specifically, we show that as the number of pseudo-absences increases (in a regular or uniform random arrangement), logistic regression slope parameters and their standard errors converge to those of the corresponding Poisson point process model. We discuss the practical implications of these results. In particular, point process modeling offers a framework for choice of the number and location of pseudo-absences, both of which are currently chosen by ad hoc and sometimes ineffective methods in ecology, a point which we illustrate by example.},

    abstract = {Although immune checkpoint inhibitor-based therapy has shown promising results in non-small cell lung cancer patients with high programmed death-ligand 1 expression, not all patients respond to therapy. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is complex and heterogeneous, making it challenging to understand the key agents and features that influence response to therapies. In this study, we leverage multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry to quantitatively assess interactions between tumor and immune cells in an effort to identify patterns occurring at multiple spatial levels of the TME. To do so, we introduce several computational methods novel to a data set of 1,269 multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry images from a cohort of 52 patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. With the spatial G-cross function, we quantify the degree of cell interaction at an entire image level, where we see significantly increased activity of cytotoxic T cells and helper T cells with epithelial tumor cells in responders to immune checkpoint inhibitor-based (P = .022 and P {\textless} .001, respectively) and decreased activity of T-regulatory cells with epithelial tumor cells compared with nonresponders (P = .010). By leveraging spatial overlap methods, we define tumor subregions (which we call the tumor “periphery,” “edge.” and “center”) and discover more localized immune-immune interactions influencing positive response, including those between cytotoxic T cells and helper T cells with antigen presenting cells in these subregions specifically. Finally, we trained an interpretable deep learning model that identified key cellular regions of interest that most influenced response classification (area under the curve = 0.71 ± 0.02). Assessing spatial interactions within these subregions further revealed new insights that were not significant at the whole image level, particularly the elevated association of antigen presenting cells and T-regulatory cells with one another in responder groups (P = .024). Altogether, we demonstrate that elucidating patterns of cell composition and interplay across multiple levels of spatial analyses can improve our understanding of the TME and better differentiate patient responses to immunotherapy.},

Multitype spatial point patterns with hierarchical interactions. Biometrics 55, 1051–1058]. The new model overcomes the main limitation of the traditional use of the Gibbs models allowing to describe systems with non-symmetric interactions between different objects. When analyzing interactions between neighbouring trees it is natural to assume that the size of a tree determines its hierarchical level: the largest trees are not influenced by any other trees than the trees in the same size class, while trees in the other size classes are influenced by the other trees in the same class as well as by all larger trees. In this paper, we describe a wide range of Gibbs models with both hierarchical and non-hierarchical interactions as well as a simulation algorithm and a parameter estimation procedure for the hierarchical models. We apply the hierarchical interaction model to the analysis of forest data consisting of locations and diameters of tree stems.},

The method is based on modelling the patterns by using a ﬂexible Gibbs point process model to characterize point-to-point interactions at different spatial scales directly. By using the Gibbs framework signiﬁcant interactions can also be captured at small scales. Subsequently, the Gibbs point process is ﬁtted by using a pseudolikelihood approximation, and we select signiﬁcant interactions automatically by using the group lasso penalty with this likelihood approximation. Thus we estimate the multivariate interactions stably even in this setting. We demonstrate the feasibility of the method with a simulation study and show its power by applying it to a large and complex rainforest plant population data set of 83 species.},

Such models are potentially useful for investigating the spatial relationships between different cell types in the tumor microenvironment, but so far studies of the TME using cell-resolution imaging have been largely limited to spatial descriptive statistics. However, MGPP models have many advantages over descriptive statistics, such as uncertainty quantification, incorporation of multiple covariates and the ability to make predictions. In this paper, we describe and apply a previously developed MGPP method, the saturated pairwise interaction Gibbs point process model, to a publicly available multiplexed imaging dataset obtained from colorectal cancer patients.

        , T cells play a critical role in tumor immune surveillance as evidenced by extensive mouse-tumor model studies as well as encouraging patient responses to adoptive T cell therapies and dendritic cell vaccines. It is well established that the interplay of tumor cells with their local cellular environment can trigger events that are immunoinhibitory to T cells. More recently it is emerging that the tumor vasculature itself constitutes an important barrier to T cells. Endothelial cells lining the vessels can suppress T cell activity, target them for destruction, and block them from gaining entry into the tumor in the first place through the deregulation of adhesion molecules. Here we review approaches to break this tumor endothelial barrier and enhance T cell activity.},

The host immune response to tumors is critical to the success of immunotherapy; however, the determinants of this response are incompletely understood. The immune cell infiltrate in tumors varies widely in density, composition, and clinical significance. The tumor vasculature is a key component of the microenvironment that can influence tumor behavior and treatment response and can be targeted through the use of antiangiogenic drugs. Blood vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells have important roles in the trafficking of immune cells, controlling the microenvironment, and modulating the immune response. Improving access to the tumor through vascular alteration with antiangiogenic drugs may prove an effective combinatorial strategy with immunotherapy approaches and might be applicable to many tumor types.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) represent a major component of the breast tumor microenvironment and have known immunosuppressive functions in addition to their well-established roles in directly promoting tumor growth and metastasis. Here we utilized paired syngeneic mouse mammary carcinoma models to show that CAF abundance is associated with insensitivity to combination αCTLA4 and αPD-L1 ICB. CAF-rich tumors exhibited an immunologically cold tumor microenvironment, with transcriptomic, flow cytometric, and quantitative histopathologic analyses demonstrating a relationship between CAF density and a CD8+ T-cell–excluded tumor phenotype. The CAF receptor Endo180 (Mrc2) is predominantly expressed on myofibroblastic CAFs, and its genetic deletion depleted a subset of αSMA-expressing CAFs and impaired tumor progression in vivo. The addition of wild-type, but not Endo180-deficient, CAFs in coimplantation studies restricted CD8+ T-cell intratumoral infiltration, and tumors in Endo180 knockout mice exhibited increased CD8+ T-cell infiltration and enhanced sensitivity to ICB compared with tumors in wild-type mice. Clinically, in a trial of melanoma patients, high MRC2 mRNA levels in tumors were associated with a poor response to αPD-1 therapy, highlighting the potential benefits of therapeutically targeting a specific CAF subpopulation in breast and other CAF-rich cancers to improve clinical responses to immunotherapy.},

The ability of the immune system to kill tumour cells is a natural and extremely effective defence mechanism for fighting cancer. Cytotoxic-T-cells are a critical component of our immune system which function is to eliminate cancer cells. In some cancers, especially those with a rich tumour stroma, these cytotoxic-T-cells are unable to reach and kill the tumour cells. Cancer-associated fibroblasts are the most abundant cells in the tumour stroma and play a key role of the recruitment, infiltration and function of cytotoxic T-cells in the tumour, via several molecular mechanisms which we describe in this review.
Abstract
The tumour microenvironment (TME) is the complex environment in which various non-cancerous stromal cell populations co-exist, co-evolve and interact with tumour cells, having a profound impact on the progression of solid tumours. The TME is comprised of various extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in addition to a variety of immune and stromal cells. These include tumour-associated macrophages, regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells, as well as endothelial cells, pericytes and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs are the most abundant stromal cell population in many tumours and support cancer progression, metastasis and resistance to therapies through bidirectional signalling with both tumour cells and other cells within the TME. More recently, CAFs have been shown to also affect the anti-tumour immune response through direct and indirect interactions with immune cells. In this review, we specifically focus on the interactions between CAFs and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, and on how these interactions affect T cell recruitment, infiltration and function in the tumour. We additionally provide insight into the therapeutic implications of targeting these interactions, particularly in the context of cancer immunotherapy.},

EMT is primed by tumor microenvironment (TME)-derived signals, whereupon cancer cells undergoing EMT in turn remodel the TME, thereby modulating tumor progression and therapeutic response. This review discusses the mechanisms by which EMT coordinates TME dynamics, including secretion of soluble factors, direct cell contact, release of exosomes and enzymes, as well as metabolic reprogramming. Recent evidence also indicates that cells undergoing EMT may differentiate into cancer-associated fibroblasts, thereby establishing themselves as functional constituents of the TME. Elucidating the relationship between EMT and the TME offers novel perspectives for therapeutic strategies to enhance cancer treatment efficacy. Although EMT-directed therapies present significant therapeutic potential, the current lack of effective targeting approaches—attributable to EMT complexity and its microenvironmental context dependency—underscores the necessity for mechanistic investigations and translational clinical validation.},

This review aims to summarize the immunomodulatory roles of CAFs, particularly focussing on their T-cell suppressive effects., Cancer-associated fibroblasts have several ways by which they can affect the tumour’s immune microenvironment (TIME). For example, their interactions with macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) create an immunosuppressive milieu that can indirectly affect T-cell anticancer immunity and enable immune evasion. In addition, a number of recent studies have confirmed CAF-mediated direct suppressive effects on T-cell anticancer capacity through ECM remodelling, promoting the expression of immune checkpoints, cytokine secretion and the release of extracellular vesicles. The consequential impact of CAFs on T-cell function is then reflected in affecting T-cell proliferation and apoptosis, migration and infiltration, differentiation and exhaustion. Emerging evidence highlights the existence of specific CAF subsets with distinct capabilities to modulate the immune landscape of TME in various cancers, suggesting the possibility of their exploitation as possible prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.},

Materials and Methods: We probed formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue microarrays using a novel tyramide signal amplification multiplexing technique labelling CD8, CD4, Foxp3, and CD68+ cells. Each multiplex stained immunohistochemistry slide was digitally processed by Vectra INFORMS software, and an X- and Y-coordinate assigned to each labeled cell type. The abundance and spatial location of each cell type and their proximity to one another was analyzed using a novel application of the G-cross spatial distance distribution method which computes the probability of finding at least one immune cell of any given type within a r \textmu m radius of a tumor cell. Cox proportional hazards multiple regression was used for multivariate analysis of the influence of proximity of lymphocyte types. Results: Pathologic tumor specimens from 120 NSCLC patients with pathologic tumor stage I-III disease were analyzed. On univariate analysis, age (P=0.0007) and number of positive nodes (P=0.0014) were associated with overall survival. Greater area under the curve (AUC) of the Gcross function for tumor cell-Treg interactions was significantly associated with worse survival adjusting for age and number of positive nodes (HR 1.52 (1.11--2.07), P=0.009). Greater G-cross AUC for T-reg-CD8 was significantly associated with better survival adjusting for age and number of positive lymph nodes (HR 0.96 (0.92--0.99), P=0.042). Conclusion: Increased infiltration of regulatory T cells into core tumor regions is an independent predictor of worse overall survival in NSCLC. However, increased infiltration of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells among regulatory T cells seems to mitigate this effect and was significantly associated with better survival.

This allows the complex cellular architecture and environment of diseased tissue to be explored. While spatial analysis techniques have revealed how cell--cell interactions are important within the disease pathology, there remains a gap in exploring changes in these interactions within the disease process. Specifically, there are currently few established methods for performing inference on cell-type co-localization changes across images, hindering an understanding of how cellular environments change with a disease pathology.},

Relating measures of spatial clustering, such as Ripley's K or Besag's L, to patient outcomes may offer important clinical insights. However, these measures require pre-specifying a radius in which to quantify clustering, yet no consensus exists on the optimal radius which may be context-specific.We propose a SPatial Omnibus Test (SPOT) which conducts this analysis across a range of candidate radii. At each radius, SPOT evaluates the association between the spatial summary and outcome, adjusting for confounders. SPOT then aggregates results across radii using the Cauchy combination test, yielding an omnibus P-value characterizing the overall degree of association. Using simulations, we verify that the type I error rate is controlled and show SPOT can be more powerful than alternatives. We also apply SPOT to ovarian and lung cancer studies.An R package and tutorial are provided at https://github.com/sarahsamorodnitsky/SPOT.},

Exploring the potential variations in the spatial co-occurrence or colocalization of different cell types across distinct tissue or disease classes can provide significant pathological insights, paving the way for intervention strategies. However, the existing methods in this context either rely on stringent statistical assumptions or suffer from a lack of generalizability. We present a highly powerful method to study differential spatial co-occurrence of cell types across multiple tissue or disease groups, based on the theories of the Poisson point process and functional analysis of variance. Notably, the method accommodates multiple images per subject and addresses the problem of missing tissue regions, commonly encountered due to data-collection complexities. We demonstrate the superior statistical power and robustness of the method in comparison with existing approaches through realistic simulation studies. Furthermore, we apply the method to three real data sets on different diseases collected using different imaging platforms. In particular, one of these data sets reveals novel insights into the spatial characteristics of various types of colorectal adenoma.},

Recent advances in imaging techniques enable researchers to study spatial structure of the TME at a single-cell level. Investigating spatial patterns and interactions of cell subtypes within the TME provides useful insights into how cells with different biological purposes behave, which may consequentially impact a subject's clinical outcomes. We utilize a class of well-known spatial summary statistics, the K-function and its variants, to explore inter-cell dependence as a function of distances between cells. Using techniques from functional data analysis, we introduce an approach to model the association between these summary spatial functions and subject-level outcomes, while controlling for other clinical scalar predictors such as age and disease stage. In particular, we leverage the additive functional Cox regression model (AFCM) to study the nonlinear impact of spatial interaction between tumor and stromal cells on overall survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, using multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) data. The applicability of our approach is further validated using a publicly available multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) triple-negative breast cancer dataset.},

The interaction between the immune system and cancer cells has predictive and prognostic potential across different tumor types. Spatially resolved tissue-based technologies allowed researchers to simultaneously quantify different immune populations in tumor samples. However, bare quantification fails to harness the spatial nature of tissue-based technologies. Tumor-immune interactions are associated with specific spatial patterns that can be measured. In recent years, several computational tools have been developed to increase our understanding of these spatial patterns.Topics covered In this review, we cover standard techniques as well as new advances in the field of spatial analysis of the immune microenvironment. We focused on marker quantification, spatial intratumor heterogeneity analysis, cell-cell spatial interaction studies and neighborhood analyses.},

  abstract = {Many ecological questions could gain insight from linking variation in spatial structure to explanatory variables. Although methods that make these links have been developed in the statistical literature, they have been used rarely in ecology. We present an approach that considers point patterns from different sources (e.g. multiple plots or species) as replicates of the spatial processes of interest. Using an integrated two-step procedure, the method uses a linear mixed-effects modelling framework to explain variation in the spatial structure of the replicated patterns with categorical and continuous predictors. Inferences on the strength of the relationships between the predictors and spatial structure are made on the basis of a semi-parametric bootstrap procedure that accounts for the dependency among spatial scales and, if required, among replicates. We illustrate the approach with three simulated examples. These demonstrate that replicated analyses can increase the performance of spatial point pattern analyses, allow analysis of sparse patterns (e.g. rare species) and help identify the drivers of variation among spatial point patterns. The paucity of ecological studies that utilize replicated point pattern analysis may be due partly to a lack of familiarity with the methods. By highlighting the options available, we hope to encourage greater use of these methods by ecologists in the future.},

  abstract = {We develop a two-stage spatial point process model that introduces new characterizations of activation patterns in multi-subject functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies. Conventionally multi-subject fMRI methods rely on combining information across subjects one voxel at a time in order to identify locations of peak activation in the brain. The two-stage model that we develop here addresses shortcomings of standard methods by explicitly modeling the spatial stucture of functional signals and recognizing that corresponding cross-subject functional signals can be spatially misaligned. In our first stage analysis, we introduce a marked spatial point process model that captures the spatial features of the functional response and identifies a configuration of activation units for each subject. The locations of these activation units are used as input for the second stage model. The point process model of the second stage analysis is developed to characterize multi-subject activation patterns by estimating the strength of cross-subject interactions at different spatial ranges. The model uses spatial neighborhoods to account for the cross-subject spatial misalignment in corresponding functional units. We applied our methods to an fMRI study of 21 individuals who performed an attention test. We identified four brain regions that are involved in the test and found that our model results agree well with our understanding of how these regions engage with the tasks performed during the attention test. Our results highlighted that cross-subject interactions are stronger in brain areas that have a more specific function in performing the experimental tasks than in other areas.},

We take a maximum pseudolikelihood approach (besag :1976) to parameter estimation in the context of Gibbs processes (Stoyan et al., 1995, Illian et al., 2008). More specifically, we discuss pair-wise interaction processes where the conditional intensity has a log-linear form and extend existing models by expressing the intensity and the interaction terms in the pseudolikelihood as a sum of fixed and random effects, where the latter accounts for variation over time. We initially derive a Strauss process model with mixed effects. As this model is too simplistic in the given context, we further consider a more general model that allows for inter-group differences in intensity and interaction strength and has a more flexible interaction function. We apply the approximate Berman--Turner device (Baddeley and Turner, 2000) to a generalised linear mixed model with log link and Poisson outcome rather than a simple generalised linear model. Estimates are obtained using existing software for generalised linear mixed models based on penalised quasi-likelihood methods (Bresow and Clayton, 1993). The approach is applied to a data set detailing the spatial locations of different types of muskoxen herds in a fixed area in Greenland at different points in time within several years (Meltofte and Berg, 2004).
