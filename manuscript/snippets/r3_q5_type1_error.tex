Coverage and type I error performance (Supplement Section~\ref{sec:coverage_type1}) reveal adaptive calibration. When source density is high (favorable for detection), SHADE trades calibration for sensitivity (55\% coverage, 100\% power, $<$1\% type I error). When both densities are low (unfavorable for detection), SHADE becomes appropriately conservative (94\% coverage, 28\% power, 4\% type I error). This contrasts with SHADE Flat, which maintains poor coverage (73\%) regardless of scenario and shows severely inflated type I error rates (28\%). Median type I error rates for SHADE Hierarchical with 2--3 images are well-controlled (0.8--7.5\%), comparable to envelope tests (G-cross: 2.5--8.8\%; K-cross: 1.3--6.7\%), though with higher variability (IQR up to 0.12), indicating occasional liberal inference under challenging conditions.
