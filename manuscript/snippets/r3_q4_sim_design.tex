We simulated spatial point patterns with patient- and image-level hierarchical structure (40 patients, 1--3 images per patient) using radial basis functions to model positive spatial interactions at short-, medium-, and long-range scales. We varied source cell density (the conditioning cell type: 15 vs.\ 150 cells per image) and target cell density (the cell type being modeled: 15 vs.\ 150 cells per image) across 50 replicates per condition.
