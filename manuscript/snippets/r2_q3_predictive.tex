Our modeling framework captures \emph{predictive} spatial associations, not biological causation. A strong \( A \to B \) SIC indicates that type $A$ cell locations are statistically predictive of local type $B$ density, formally meaning that the conditional intensity $\lambda(v \mid X_A)$ differs from the marginal intensity $\lambda_B(v)$. While SICs quantify the strength and direction of spatial predictability, they do not establish causal biological effects. The model can incorporate spatial covariates (e.g., distance to tumor margin) to adjust for confounding from first-order intensity effects.
