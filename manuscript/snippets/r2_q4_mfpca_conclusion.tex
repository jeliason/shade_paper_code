This comparison illustrates the complementary nature of SHADE and FDA approaches: SHADE's conditional modeling isolates directional effects while adjusting for confounders, whereas mFPCA characterizes marginal pairwise variation without multivariate adjustment. Both perspectives contribute to understanding group-level spatial organization in the tumor microenvironment.
