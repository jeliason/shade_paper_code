For comparison, we evaluated three baseline approaches: (1) $G$-cross envelope tests~\citep{baddeley_spatial_2015}, testing whether the observed nearest-neighbor distribution falls outside 95\% global envelopes constructed from 99 completely spatially random (CSR) simulations; (2) $K$-cross (specifically, $L$-cross) envelope tests, using cumulative counts rather than nearest-neighbor distances; and (3) a `Flat' model that estimates SICs independently for each image without hierarchical pooling. Type I error rates were assessed using null simulations with zero spatial interactions.
