Detection power comparison across simulation conditions.
Boxplots show the proportion of datasets in which methods correctly identify non-zero spatial interactions by testing whether simultaneous credible bands (SHADE) or global envelopes (G-cross, K-cross) exclude zero anywhere in the 0--75~$\mu$m range. Results are stratified by source cell density (rows: the conditioning cell type) and target cell density (columns: the cell type being modeled), with number of images per patient (1, 2, or 3) shown on the x-axis. SHADE Hierarchical achieves highest power when source density is high, with performance when source density is low depending critically on having multiple images per patient available for hierarchical pooling (see main text).
