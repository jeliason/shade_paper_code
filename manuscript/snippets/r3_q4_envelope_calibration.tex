Global envelopes were constructed using $99$ Monte Carlo simulations of point patterns generated according to complete spatial randomness (CSR). The rank parameters were calibrated in preliminary null scenario simulations to achieve proper Type I error control: \texttt{nrank = 10} for $G$-cross (yielding nominal significance level $\alpha = 10/100 = 0.10$) and \texttt{nrank = 8} for $L$-cross (yielding $\alpha = 8/100 = 0.08$). These nominal levels achieved empirical Type I error rates of 2.5--8.8\% for $G$-cross and 1.3--6.7\% for $L$-cross across different density regimes (\secref{ssec:coverage_type1}).
