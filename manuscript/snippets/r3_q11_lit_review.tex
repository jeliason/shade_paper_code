Benchmarking studies have compared classical spatial summary statistics (Ripley's $K$-function, $G$-cross) for detecting co-localization in mIF and IMC data~\citep{soupirBenchmarkingSpatialCoLocalization2025}, while functional data analysis methods such as mxfda~\citep{wrobelMxfdaComprehensiveToolkit2024} apply multilevel functional PCA to spatial summary statistics, decomposing variation across hierarchical levels without imposing parametric models on point patterns. While such methods effectively characterize dominant modes of variation in marginal pairwise associations~\citep{diggle_statistical_2013}, they do not model conditional relationships or enable joint estimation with partial pooling at the point process level.
