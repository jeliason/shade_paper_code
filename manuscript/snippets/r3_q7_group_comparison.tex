When comparing spatial organization across biological groups (e.g., treatment responders vs. non-responders, different tumor subtypes), each group is modeled as a separate cohort with its own cohort-level parameters $\psi_{A_k}^{(g,p)}$. Differences between groups are then assessed by comparing the posterior distributions of these cohort-level parameters, as quantified through SICs (Equation~\ref{eq:sic}) and their associated simultaneous credible bands.
