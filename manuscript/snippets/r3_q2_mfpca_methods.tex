We computed $G$-cross and $L$-cross functions for all 15 source-target pairs at distances from 0 to 75~$\mu$m, ran mFPCA separately for each group (pve = 0.99), and extracted the population mean curves with variability bands. Full mFPCA results for all pairs are provided in the Supplement (Figures~S[\#] and S[\#] for $G$-cross and $L$-cross, respectively). Visual comparison of SHADE SICs (Figure~\ref{fig:sic_CRC_diff}) with mFPCA group curves reveals both concordance and informative differences.
