We computed $G$-cross and $L$-cross functions for all 15 source-target pairs at distances from 0 to 75~$\mu$m, ran mFPCA separately for each group, and extracted the population mean curves with variability bands. Full mFPCA results for all pairs are provided in Figures~\ref{fig:mfpca_gcross_grid} and \ref{fig:mfpca_lcross_grid} for $G$-cross and $L$-cross, respectively. Visual comparison of SHADE SICs (Figure~\ref{fig:sic_crc_all}) with mFPCA group curves reveals both concordance and informative differences.
