We computed $G$-cross and $L$-cross functions for all 15 source-target pairs at distances from 0 to 75~$\mu$m, ran mFPCA separately for each group, and extracted the population mean curves with variability bands. Full mFPCA results for all pairs are provided in \figref{sfig:mfpca_gcross_grid} and \figref{sfig:mfpca_lcross_grid} for $G$-cross and $L$-cross, respectively. Visual comparison of SHADE SICs (\figref{fig:sic_crc_all}) with mFPCA group curves reveals both concordance and informative differences.
