Comparing heterogeneity patterns between CLR and DII tumor subtypes reveals subtype-specific differences in variability (Figure~\ref{fig:mad_clr_dii}). DII tumors exhibit greater heterogeneity for specific interactions (e.g., memory CD4+ T cells with tumor cells, granulocytes with vasculature), while CLR tumors show greater heterogeneity in granulocyte-stromal interactions (e.g., granulocyte-CAF, granulocyte-hybrid E/M). These patterns hold at both patient and image levels, demonstrating that tumor subtype affects not only mean spatial organization (Section~\ref{sec:hot_cold}) but also the variability of spatial interactions across biological scales.
