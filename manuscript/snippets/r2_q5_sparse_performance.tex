When source density is high (regardless of target density), SHADE achieves excellent median power (100\%) across all conditions, substantially outperforming envelope tests when target density is low (SHADE 100\% vs. G-cross 77\%, K-cross 73\%). Abundant source cells provide strong conditioning information that hierarchical pooling can effectively leverage. Conversely, when source density is low, performance depends on whether multiple images are available: with 2--3 images per patient, median power reaches 100\%; with only 1 image, power drops to 31\% as limited conditioning information per image prevents effective pooling.
