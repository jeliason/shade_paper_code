This curve represents the expected contribution of type \( A_k \) cells to the log-intensity of type \( B \) cells as a function of distance \( s \) from a type \( A_k \) cell. Here, log-intensity refers to the logarithm of the conditional intensity function $\lambda(v)$ (Equation~\ref{eq:cond_int_simplified}), which describes the expected spatial density of type $B$ cells (in cells per unit area) at any location $v$. Because the model is log-linear, SIC values quantify additive changes on the log-intensity scale, which correspond to multiplicative changes in actual cell density. For example, $\text{SIC} = 0.2$ at distance $s$ implies an $e^{0.2} \approx 1.22\times$ (or 22\%) increase in the expected local density of type $B$ cells at radius $s$ from a type $A_k$ cell, while $\text{SIC} = -0.3$ corresponds to an $e^{-0.3} \approx 0.74\times$ decrease (26\% reduction).
