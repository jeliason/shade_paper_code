We found that on average, and across all spatial scales, the average RMSE of \( \delta_{t_1 \to t_2}^{(m,p)} \) coefficients was lower for those estimated by the full hierarchical model than the model that fit images individually, most significantly so for closer-range coefficients (\tabref{stab:hier_rmse}).
