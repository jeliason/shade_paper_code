While such approaches can descriptively characterize heterogeneity by comparing per-image summaries across patients or experimental groups, they cannot formally decompose variance components or perform partial pooling within a unified statistical framework that borrows strength across images, patients, and cohorts.

% these approaches either apply hierarchical regression to spatial summary statistics (e.g., $K$-function), use two-stage procedures that separately estimate per-replicate patterns before modeling cross-replicate variation, or fit parametric Gibbs models via maximum pseudolikelihood with random effects, rather than fully Bayesian joint estimation of flexible interaction functions across multiple biological scales. Summary-based methods cannot model conditional interactions at the point process level, while pseudolikelihood approaches with mixed effects impose parametric interaction forms and rely on frequentist approximations rather than full Bayesian posterior inference. This leaves a methodological gap: no existing framework jointly estimates flexible, interpretable spatial interaction curves while borrowing strength across images, patients, and cohorts through multilevel Bayesian inference.

Standard pipelines for analyzing spatial cellular interactions in multiplexed imaging data typically compute second-order summary statistics, such as Ripley's $K$- and $L$-functions or the $G$-cross function, independently for each image to quantify tumor–immune interactions, infiltration patterns, or neighborhood structure \citep{baruaSpatialInteractionTumor2018,vuSPFSpatialFunctional2022,caneteSpicyRSpatialAnalysis2022,samorodnitskySpatialOmnibusTest2024,sealSpaceANOVASpatialCooccurrence2024,jingQuantifyingInterpretingBiologically2025,janeiroSpatiallyResolvedTissue2024,soupirBenchmarkingSpatialCoLocalization2025}. These per-image summaries are then compared across groups or used as covariates in downstream analyses. Although effective for descriptive comparisons, this approach treats each image as an isolated point pattern and cannot share information across biological replicates during estimation. Hierarchical models for replicated point patterns have been proposed \citep{bagchiMethodAnalysingReplicated2015a,leeCharacterizingCrosssubjectSpatial2017,myllymakiHierarchicalSecondorderAnalysis2014,bellMixedModelsAnalysis2004,illianGibbsPointProcess2010,wrobelMxfdaComprehensiveToolkit2024}, but they typically model derived summaries via two-stage estimation or use parametric models fit via pseudolikelihood with random effects, rather than jointly estimating flexible interaction functions through full Bayesian multilevel inference at the point-process level.
