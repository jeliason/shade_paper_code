standard spatial summary statistics such as Ripley's $K$-function and the $G$-cross function compute estimates separately for each image without explicit hierarchical structure~\citep{baddeley_spatial_2015,diggle_statistical_2013}, limiting their ability to formally model and partition heterogeneity across biological scales. While such methods can describe variability by computing per-image statistics, they do not enable joint estimation with partial pooling or explicit decomposition of variance components across images, patients, and cohorts
