To quantify uncertainty in estimated SICs and assess statistical significance, we employ simultaneous 95\% credible bands that account for multiple comparisons across the distance domain. Unlike pointwise credible intervals, simultaneous bands provide joint coverage across all distances within a specified range, offering stronger protection against false discoveries. Statistical significance can be assessed by examining whether the simultaneous band excludes zero over a distance range of interest. Full implementation details are provided in the Supplement (\secref{ssec:sim_band}).

In exploratory analyses involving many cell type pairs ($K(K-1)$ directed pairs for $K$ cell types), we propose summary measures to facilitate prioritization: peak location and magnitude (identifying where the strongest interaction occurs), persistence over biologically relevant distance ranges (quantifying consistent associations within pre-specified intervals), and overall strength (integrating absolute effect sizes over significant regions). These measures can be computed across all source--target pairs and visualized as heatmaps for systematic comparison. Formal definitions are provided in the Supplement (\secref{ssec:screening_supplement}).
