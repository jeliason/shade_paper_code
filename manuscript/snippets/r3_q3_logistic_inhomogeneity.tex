This approximation does not require the target cell process to be homogeneous—only the dummy points are placed homogeneously for computational convenience. Target cells are still modeled as an inhomogeneous Poisson process with spatial variation captured through distance-based SIC features $\bq_{A_k}(v)$ and spatial covariates $\bz(v)$ (Equation~\ref{eq:cond_int_simplified}). In our colorectal cancer analysis, we demonstrate this flexibility by incorporating compartment indicators to control for tissue architecture (Section~\ref{sec:hot_cold}), showing how covariates can disentangle spatial interactions from architectural confounding.
