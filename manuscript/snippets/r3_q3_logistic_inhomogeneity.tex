Importantly, this approximation does not require the target cell process to be homogeneous—only the dummy/quadrature points are placed homogeneously for computational convenience. Target cells are still modeled as an inhomogeneous Poisson process via the conditional intensity $\lambda(v)$, with spatial variation captured through distance-based SIC features $\bq_{A_k}(v)$ and optional spatial covariates $\bz(v)$ (Equation~\ref{eq:cond_int_simplified}). While our later analysis does not explicitly model compartmental variation in baseline rates, the SIC features already capture local variation driven by proximity to different cell types. The framework is extensible to include compartment indicators or other spatially-varying features as additional covariates if discrete tissue domains are suspected to drive baseline intensity differences independent of cell-cell interactions.
