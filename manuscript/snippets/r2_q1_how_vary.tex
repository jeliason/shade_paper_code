Unlike descriptive spatial statistics that compute separate summaries for each image, SHADE's hierarchical Bayesian model jointly estimates SICs at the image, patient, and cohort levels through partial pooling. This enables formal decomposition and quantification of variability at each biological scale, allowing us to assess both intra- and inter-patient variability and distinguish conserved from patient-specific spatial patterns.
