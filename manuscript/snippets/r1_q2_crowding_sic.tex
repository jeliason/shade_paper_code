Because cell centroids cannot occur arbitrarily close in space, very short distances (below approximately 1-2 cell diameters) can reflect geometric crowding, cell-cell contact, or segmentation artifacts, making biological interpretation ambiguous. We therefore predefine a minimum interaction radius $r_{\min} = 25~\mu$m (approximately 1.5-2 typical cell diameters) and report spatial interaction curves only for $r\ge r_{\min}$. The model is fit using all observed cell locations, but posterior summaries and spatial interaction curves are evaluated and reported only at distances $r \ge r_{\min}$ to focus interpretation on unambiguous intercellular spacing. All band-level posterior probabilities are computed on intervals $I\subseteq [r_{\min},\infty)$.
